# ✈ Flight Delay & Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes airline operational performance, delay patterns, and revenue insights.  

The dashboard is divided into two main analytical pages:

1️⃣ Flight Performance Overview  
2️⃣ Operational Delay Analysis  

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into airline efficiency, delay reasons, airport impact, and revenue performance.
